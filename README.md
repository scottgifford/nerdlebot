## Nerdlebot
A friendly robot for playing Nerdle!

https://nerdlegame.com/

Nerdle is a game where you try to guess a simple mathematical equation Wordle-style, that is, with clues
about which numbers and operators are and aren't in the equation and whether they are in the right spot.

This bot solves them automatically, with some success.

It is also a tool to help me learn Rust, a programming language I have never used before.  Tips from experience
Crustaceans are welcome!
